My Learning Journey: Python, Photography, Japanese, and Finance

Hi there! I’m UAM and this is the start of an exciting journey where I’ll be learning and documenting my progress in Python, photography, Japanese, and finance. Whether you're a fellow learner, a curious reader, or someone looking to pick up one of these skills, I hope to share insights, tutorials, and reflections that will help us all grow together.

Who Am I?

I’m someone who’s always had a passion for learning new things, and now I’ve decided to embark on a journey that spans across multiple fields. From writing code to capturing beautiful moments with a camera, I’m diving into a variety of disciplines that keep me both challenged and motivated.

Here’s a bit more about the four areas I’m focusing on:

1. Python Programming

Why Python? Well, I believe it’s one of the most versatile and beginner-friendly programming languages out there. My goal is to master Python so that I can build useful tools, automate tasks, and maybe even take on side projects as I grow. I'll be sharing tutorials, scripts, and my progress in learning Python.

2. Photography

I’m learning photography because I want to capture the world through my own lens—literally! Using my Samsung S24 Ultra, I’m practicing how to take and edit personal pictures. I’m not aiming for professional photography, but I do want to develop a creative eye and improve my skills in editing and composition. I'll share photography tips, techniques, and my progress.

3. Japanese Language

I’ve always been fascinated by the Japanese language and culture, and now I’m dedicating time to learn it properly. My goal is not to become a professional translator, but to enjoy the process of learning a new language and connect more deeply with Japanese media and culture. I’ll be documenting my study methods, resources, and tips for those who are also learning Japanese.

4. Finance and Trading

Lastly, I’m diving into finance and trading to better understand the market and learn how to make smart financial decisions. I’ll be exploring everything from basic personal finance to more advanced trading strategies, with the aim of improving my financial literacy and hopefully generating extra income in the future.

The Tools I Use

A big part of this journey is staying organized and productive. Here are the tools that help me along the way:

Todoist: My go-to for task management. I break down my weekly learning goals for Python, photography, Japanese, and finance into actionable tasks. Todoist keeps me on track with recurring tasks and deadlines.

Evernote: I use Evernote to draft blog ideas, take notes on what I’m learning, and store helpful resources for quick reference. It’s perfect for brainstorming and keeping track of my thoughts.

Obsidian: For deep note-taking and connecting the dots between the various things I’m learning, Obsidian serves as my Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) system. I use it to organize ideas and link related concepts across subjects.

Proton Drive: This is where I store all my important files, from blog drafts to photography edits. Proton Drive keeps my work backed up and accessible from anywhere.

Proton Calendar: Time management is key when juggling multiple subjects. I use Proton Calendar to schedule dedicated time blocks for deep work on each subject and to remind myself when it’s time to write, study, or practice.


What’s Coming Next?

On this blog, I’ll be sharing:

Weekly progress updates: I’ll recap what I’ve learned each week, from coding projects to language study breakthroughs.

Tutorials and guides: As I pick up new skills in Python and finance, I’ll be writing beginner-friendly tutorials that you can follow along with.

Photography tips: Expect some visual posts as I improve my photography and editing techniques.

Language learning insights: I’ll share what’s working for me in learning Japanese, including the resources and study strategies I’m using.


If you’re also learning one or more of these topics or just curious to see how this journey unfolds, feel free to follow along! I’m excited to share my learning process and connect with others who are on a similar path.

Let’s learn and grow together!
